This was done using data collected from previous results of NFL regular season field goal attempts during 2008. Odds ratios, goodness-of-fit tests, and success probability curves were utilized for this analysis. Kicking distance appeared to be negatively associated with the ability to make a field goal attempt.<br><br></font>

                        <font color = "black">A R Markdown Shiny app program was used to generate a data analysis dashboard of numerical variables from the penguin information dataset from the previous assignment. Mainly, this shiny app can allow the relationship between two variables to be analyzed with a scatterplot, a linear regression scatterplot with a line of best fit, diagnostic plots, and a data point prediction on the scatterplot. There are also box plots showing distributions of values for the chosen explanatory (X) variable and ridge plots showing distributions of values for the chosen response (Y) variable. The prediction value for plotting this prediction point is determined a slider scale on the side panel. The main variables used for these include bill length, bill depth, flipper length (all of these in millimeters), and body mass index (BMI) of the penguins. The island/location of each sampled penguin (Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen, or All) acts as a data filter for this analysis. The first scatterplot, the box plots, and the ridge plots were separated and/or colored by which island location each sampled penguin was located when the "All" option was applied.<br><br></font>

                        <font color = "black">A R Markdown Shiny app program was used to generate a data analysis dashboard of numerical variables from a 2023 dataset of apsects of Major League Baseball (MLB) batters. Mainly, this shiny app can allow the relationship between two variables to be analyzed with a scatterplot, a linear regression scatterplot with a line of best fit, diagnostic plots, a data point prediction on the scatterplot, and regression coefficients for the chosen variables. There are also box plots showing distributions of values for the chosen explanatory (X) variable. The prediction value for plotting this prediction point is determined a slider scale on the side panel. The main variables used for these include number of hits each player got (H), number of runs they scored (R), number of home runs they got (HR), number of walks (BB), number of strike-outs (SO), and the number of times they come up to hit (AtBats/AB). The team that each sampled player is on (total of 30) acts as a data filter for this analysis.<br><br></font>

                        <font color = "black">Data was taken to see how the price of houses in Taipei, Taiwan were affected by different factors based on time and location. House price of unit area acts as the dependent variable. Independent variables include year of transaction, house age, distance from the house to the nearest MRT station, number of nearby convenience stores, and the house’s latitude and longitude. Simple linear regression was used as a starting point for the analysis, and different models, including an initial model, a log-transformed model with no interactions, and an interactions model, were created. It was deduced that the log-transformed model was the optimal one, once the non-significant variables were removed. There is also a map included that shows the locations in Taiwan where the houses sampled are.<br><br></font>

                        <font color = "black">For this analysis, two validated and reliable survey instruments, the Self-Compassion Scale and the Gratitude Questionnaire, were used to measure levels of self-compassion and gratitude in students. We wanted to see how self-compassion of BSW and MSW students in a Social Work Program at a regional university ties in to other demographic variables. This can help others to study self-compassion in the students and how it connects to their gratitude, self-care, and success in the social work field. This data set will go through some data management before it is used for analysis. We will impute missing values in each item of the self-compassion and gratitude survey instruments. Then, we will extract the first two principal component (PC) scores from each survey instrument using principal component analysis (PCA). As for missing values in the demographic variables, they are replaced with 99. These demographic variables will then be re-categorized to fix imbalance categories. These four principal components and re-categorized demographic variables will make up the final analytic data set to be use for analysis. With this final data set, we will run exploratory data analysis (EDA) on descriptive statistics of the data. Then, we will build a candidate linear analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) regression model and work towards a final model.<br><br></font>

                        <font color = "black">Goal was to compare performances of three random sampling plans (simple, systematic, and stratified) for data from the U.S. Small Business Administration, using loan default rates as a reference metric. Franchise Code was used to distribute the study population into separate sub-populations. Once three random samples are drawn from these populations, the comparison is presented with graphs followed by a discussion of the results. The effectiveness of the three different random sampling plans is shown by differences in the default rates and sample rates of the newly made sub-populations. It appeared that the simple random sampling (SRS) plan performed the best and should be the type of random sample used in this analysis.</font>
