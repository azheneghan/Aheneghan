This was done using data collected from previous results of NFL regular season field goal attempts during 2008. Odds ratios, goodness-of-fit tests, and success probability curves were utilized for this analysis. Kicking distance appeared to be negatively associated with the ability to make a field goal attempt.<br><br></font>

                        <font color = "black">The Framingham Heart Study dataset was used to create a dashboard and story points in Tableau displaying different graphs and tables about the different variables in the data. Categorical variables had to have values rewritten to be able to be used in Tableau. There is a table displaying presence of diabetes by education level, a bar chart of average total cholesterol (mg/dL) by presence of diabetes by education level, a line plot of age vs BMI by gender, a scatterplot with trend lines for systolic vs diastolic blood pressure (mmHg) by presence of diabetes, and finally a histogram of the distribution of total cholesterol (mg/dL) by gender. Smoking status of the subjects acts as a filter for all of these graphs.<br><br></font>

                        <font color = "black">A R Shiny app program was used to generate a random set of numbers and then visualize the binomial distribution of these numbers as a histogram. Different input bars are present in the app to change the values of the parameters used in a binomial distribution. This includes the number experiemnts (x), the number of trials per experiment (n), and the probability of success (p). This will cause the binomial distribution visualization to change based on what parameter values are implemented. There is also a normal density curve added to this histogram as well.</font>
