                        <font color = "black">A simple linear regression was run to observe if there was association between whether a football player can successfully make a field goal attempt and the distance that a football is kicked from during a game to score it. This was done using data collected from previous results of NFL regular season field goal attempts during 2008. Odds ratios, goodness-of-fit tests, and success probability curves were utilized for this analysis. Kicking distance appeared to be negatively associated with the ability to make a field goal attempt.<br><br></font>

Observations with missing values are not included either. The two separate colors of the points represent the species of penguin each individual penguin belongs to.

A subset of this merged dataset, containing only observations from the year of 2000, was used to make the ggplot() scatterplot. Income and life expectancy of these countries act as the two variables on the axes that are being compared to one another. Point size represents each country's populations size, and the colors of the points represent the region or continent each country is located in. Overall, it seemed life expectancy tended to increases if income increased as well, and some countries or continents were better off than others in this case.
